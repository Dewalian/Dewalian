# About Me
Hi! I'm a game developer / programmer specialized in Unity. I'm always interested on programming difficult and complex game design, trying to push my skill and boundaries as a programmer. I'm currenty a student at Bina Nusantara University, Faculty of Computer Science, majoring in Game Application and Technology, fifth-semester. When it comes to programming, I specialize in structured code and scripts, making them as decoupled as possible to avoid further problems and easier to debug. I also am very flexible, as I have experience as a game artist and game designer.
