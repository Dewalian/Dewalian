<h2>About Me</h2>
<p align="justify">Hi! I'm a game developer / programmer specialized in Unity. I'm always interested on programming difficult and complex game design, trying to push my skill and boundaries as a programmer. I'm currenty a student at Bina Nusantara University, Faculty of Computer Science, majoring in Game Application and Technology, fifth-semester. When it comes to programming, I specialize in structured code and scripts, making them as decoupled as possible to avoid further problems and easier to debug. I'm very efficient and fast when it comes to finishing all sort of task. I also am very flexible, as I have experience as a game artist and game designer.</p>

A tower defense game where you have to protect the scattered crystals from the dangerous creatures in the forest. You play as Luke, a knight from the Gear'm Kingdom where you have to search for resource on the map to build unique offensive towers across the paths. I am the only artist in this game, where I use Aseprite to make pixel arts.

In a mysterious island, a freaky giant was spotted. A team has been sent to deal with them. A turn based puzzle game where you drop your robots from the sky to secure areas full of giants. You only have a limited supply of robots. Make sure you use them wisely, Commander. I'm the game designer of this game. It's quite difficult to design the levels of a puzzle game I must say.
