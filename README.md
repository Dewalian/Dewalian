<h2>About Me</h2>
<p align="justify">Hi! I'm a game developer / programmer specialized in Unity. I'm always interested on programming difficult and complex game design, trying to push my skill and boundaries as a programmer. I'm currenty a student at Bina Nusantara University, Faculty of Computer Science, majoring in Game Application and Technology, fifth-semester. When it comes to programming, I specialize in structured code and scripts, making them as decoupled as possible to avoid further problems and easier to debug. I also am very flexible, as I have experience as a game artist and game designer.</p>

VOID is a topdown shooter endless game, where you are a lone spaceship in vast void of space, trying to survive against hordes of aliens. You knew you don't have a chance, but you kept going until the end. I created this game myself in a week, where I also draws all the art assets.

A tower defense game where you have to protect the scattered crystals from the dangerous creatures in the forest. You play as Luke, a knight from the Gear'm Kingdom where you have to search for resource on the map to build unique offensive towers across the paths. I am the only artist in this game, where I use Aseprite to make pixel arts.

In a mysterious island, a freaky giant was spotted. A team has been sent to deal with them. A turn based puzzle game where you drop your robots from the sky to secure areas full of giants. You only have a limited supply of robots. Make sure you use them wisely, Commander. I'm the game designer of this game. It's quite difficult to design the levels of a puzzle game I must say.
