<h2>About Me</h2>
<p align="justify">Hi! I'm a game developer / programmer specialized in Unity. I'm always interested on programming difficult and complex game design, trying to push my skill and boundaries as a programmer. I'm currenty a student at Bina Nusantara University, Faculty of Computer Science, majoring in Game Application and Technology, fifth-semester. When it comes to programming, I specialize in structured code and scripts, making them as decoupled as possible to avoid further problems and easier to debug. I also am very flexible, as I have experience as a game artist and game designer.</p>

VOID is a topdown shooter endless game, where you are a lone spaceship in vast void of space, trying to survive against hordes of aliens. You knew you don't have a chance, but you kept going until the end. I created this game myself in a week, where I also draws all the art assets.

Experience the thrill of high-speed aerial competition in our latest flight simulation game. The core mechanics are designed to highlight the realistic physics of flight, providing an immersive experience that balances entertainment with a showcase of aviation principles. As a solo programmer, technical-level designer, and UI designer, I developed this flight simulation game in 2 weeks."

TOADS-3D [Prototype] is a 3D FPS where you play as a police officer surviving a helicopter crash in a zombie-infested city. Developed in one month, as Game Programmer, I handled all programming, from movement, game mechanics to NavMesh implementation. I also managed the level design for this game.
